 re-set the forced user's time on-line to 0.

SNKUSER {Display log-on notices for forced invisibility? YES} B

 Answer YES if you want log-on and log-off notices to be
 displayed to all users when someone toggles invisibility;
 otherwise, answer NO. Note: This will also re-set the
 invisible user's time on-online to 0.

SNEAK {Display log-on notices for invisibility toggle? YES} B

 Answer YES if you want the user's current page title to be
 displayed instead of "Menuing System" in the Who's Online
 output; otherwise, answer NO if you want "Menuing System"
 to be displayed.

SHOWPG {Display page title instead of "Menuing System"? YES} B

 Answer YES if you want messages sent to all users on-line
 using the send global message command (=! default) to
 be sent to users whose "Busy" flag is set and who are not
 transferring a file or in "Opchat". Otherwise, answer NO
 if you don't want users who are "Busy" to receive global
 messages send with this command.
 NOTE: This setting also controls whether users with the
 key to page thru a "Busy" flag, option PGBSYKEY, can page
 thru "Busy".

SNDTHRU {Send global messages to "Busy" users? YES} B

 This is the name of the Menuing System on your module.
 It is used to determine what to display for the "Module"
 output in Who's Online if you chose to display current
 page title instead of "Menuing System" in option SHOWPG.
 Normally you should NOT change this unless for some
 reason your BBS has been customized and you have changed
 the this name.
 Do NOT color this!!!

MNUNAM {Menuing System} S 24 Name of Menuing System

 This is the name of the Editor module on your system. It
 is used to determine when a user is in the Editor so we
 can prevent that user from being bothered then.
 Normally you should NOT change this unless you are running
 an editor module with a different name from the default.
 Do NOT color this!!!

EDTNAM {Editor} S 24 Name of Editor module

 This is the name of the File Transfer Service module on
 your system. It is used to determine when a user is
 transferring files so that his "busy" flag can't be
 toggled OFF during the transfer.
 Normally you should NOT change this unless you are running
 a file transfer module with a different name from the
 default.
 Do NOT color this!!!

FILNAM {File Transfer Service} S 24 Name of File Transfer Service module

 This is the number of seconds between checks to see if
 users are no longer busy; setting it to a low number will
 improve the responsiveness of the module, while setting it
 to a high number increases over-all system performance.

CHKSECS {Seconds between checks for busy users? 1} N 1 10

 This is the minimum number of days in class that users
 who do not have key NMTRDKEY must transfer when they
 use the transfer days in class global command.

MINTRD {Minimum number of days to transfer? 7} N 1 999

 Answer YES if you want global chat channel topic changes
 and clearings to be recorded in the Audit Trail; otherwise
 answer NO.

STPCHG {List topic changes/clearings in Audit Trail? YES} B

 This is the minimum number of credits that the user must
 transfer to be allowed to transfer credits. This limit
 does not apply to users with the UNLTRKEY key.

MNTRFR {Minimum credits in transfer: 3600} L 1 999999

 This is the maximum number of credits that a user who does
 not have the UNLTRKEY key may post in one usage of the
 post credits global command (either positive or negative).
 Users with the UNLTRKEY key have no limit other than what
 can numerically be posted.

MXPST {Maximum credit post amount per usage: 3600} L 1 9999999

 Answer YES to this option if you want users who have the
 key to toggle invisibility (INVKEY) to be able to see
 invisible users who have the MASTER key with the Who's
 Online global, page invisible MASTER key holders, etc.;
 otherwise, answer NO.

SHWMINV {Allow your staff to see invisible Sysops? YES} B

 This number controls how often the BBS checks the file of
 suspended users to automatically unsuspend. If you use a
 midnight cleanup routine, you do not need to do this and
 should set this to 0. If you do not run a midnight
 cleanup routine, you will need to set this > 0 if you want
 automatic unsuspensions. The lower you set this (other
 than 0), the higher the drag on system performance. If not
 0 this is the number of seconds between checks, i.e. every
 3600 seconds, or 1 hour for example. Once an hour is more
 than sufficient!

CHKUNS {Seconds between unsuspend checks? 60} N 0 28800

 This is the number of seconds between checks for users who
 have been sent telegrams while "Busy", to see if they are
 still "Busy". If they are not "Busy", they will receive a
 notice that they have a telegram. Setting this option to
 0 turns it OFF. The lower you set this (other than 0), the
 higher the drag on system performance.

CHKTELS {Seconds between checks for telegrams for "Busy" users? 2} N 0 5

 This is the number of seconds between checks for user's
 alarm notifications. The lower you set this option, the
 closer the alarms will be to the desired time, but also
 the more drag on system performance.

CHKALRM {Seconds between alarm notification checks? 2} N 1 5

 This is the length of the "beep" users receive with their
 alarm notifications. A smaller number gives a shorter
 "beep", and a larger number gives a longer "beep".
 Setting it to 0 turns off the "beep".

ALRMBPS {Length of alarm notification "beep"? 5} N 0 10

 This is the number of seconds between checks for Friends
 Notice notifications to users who were "Busy" when the
 desired person logged on or off the BBS. The lower you set
 this option, the sooner users will receive their
 notifications, but also the more drag on system
 performance.

CHKFRND {Seconds between Friends Notice checks? 2} N 1 5

 This is the number of seconds users must wait between
 changing Chat Channels. You can choose to limit how often
 users can change to prevent them from annoying others by
 jumping channels constantly, causing the change notice
 messages to be displayed. Setting it to 0 means there is
 no delay and users can change topics as often as they
 wish.

CHKCHG {Seconds between Chat Channel topic changes? 3} N 0 10

another user that they will receive whether they are on-line or not, and even

stay blocked until you remove them from your blocked list. The block user
command is a toggle, so if the user is not already blocked he becomes blocked
from paging you, and if he is blocked he will no longer be blocked. You cannot
block a Sysop from paging you, however. You can also re-send the last page
you entered if it does not go through the first time. The page commands are

[1;32mThis command allows you to be alerted at a time you select, and you can think
of it as being like an alarm clock. This is handy for being alerted when you
need to leave or for certain events in games or other on-line activities.
To set a time to be alerted, you just enter the command followed by the time
you would like in 24 hour format, where 1:00:00 is 1 AM, and 13:00:00 is
1 PM, as follows:
[33m%s <HH:MM:SS>
[32mIf you should change your mind and decide you don't want to be alerted, you
can just enter the command to clear your alarm, as follows:
[33m%s
[32mTo view the alarm time you have selected, you enter the following command:
[33m%s ?
[32mThe alarm time will only be good for as long as you are on-line, so if you
log off before your alarm, it will not alert you if you come back on-line.
Also, you can set a time for the next day. For example, if it is currently
23:30:00 and you want to be alerted at 2:00:00 the next day, this will work
provided you are on-line at the alarm time.
Note that if you are "Busy" when your alarm is to alert you, you will be
alerted as soon as you are no longer "Busy".
